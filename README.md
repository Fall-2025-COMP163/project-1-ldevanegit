# COMP 163 - Project 1: Character Creator & Chronicles
# üéØ Project Overview

Build a text-based RPG character creation and story progression system that demonstrates mastery of functions and file I/O operations.

# Required Functions 
Complete these functions in project1_starter.py:

create_character(name, character_class) - Create new character

calculate_stats(character_class, level) - Calculate character stats

save_character(character, filename) - Save character to file

load_character(filename) - Load character from file

display_character(character) - Display character info

level_up(character) - Increase character level

# üé≠ Character Classes
Implement these character classes with unique stat distributions:


Warrior: High strength, low magic, high health

Mage: Low strength, high magic, medium health

Rogue: Medium strength, medium magic, low health

Cleric: Medium strength, high magic, high health

# üìÅ Required File Format
Your save_character() function must create files in this exact format:

Character Name: [name]

Class: [class]

Level: [level]

Strength: [strength]

Magic: [magic]

Health: [health]

Gold: [gold]


# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_character_creation.py -v

# Test your main program
python project1_starter.py

GitHub Testing:

After pushing your code, check the Actions tab to see automated test results:

‚úÖ Green checkmarks = tests passed
‚ùå Red X's = tests failed (click to see details)

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Protected Files

DO NOT MODIFY files in the tests/ directory

DO NOT MODIFY files in the .github/ directory

Modifying protected files will result in automatic academic integrity violation

# AI Usage Policy

‚úÖ Allowed: AI assistance for implementation, debugging, learning

üìù Required: Document AI usage in code comments

üéØ Must be able to explain: Every line of code during interview

# üìù Submission Checklist

 All required functions implemented
 
 Code passes all automated tests
 
 README updated with your documentation
 
 Interview scheduled and completed
 
 AI usage documented in code comments

# üèÜ Grading

Implementation (70%): Function correctness, file operations, error handling

Interview (30%): Code explanation and live coding challenge
